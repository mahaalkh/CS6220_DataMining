- All written solution are in 

Maha_Alkhairy_CS6220_HW3_exercise1.pdf
- All the programming solutions are in Maha_Alkhairy_CS6620_HW3.ipynb




- write_to_file.ipynb parses the data to get the titles in NIPS and VLDB 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- To Run: 
 
 - please run write_to_file.ipynb to get the NIPS_titles.txt & VLDB_titles.txt which is used in the last part.  
- I am referring to publications.txt in Maha_Alkhairy_CS6620_HW3.ipynb as "publications.txt"  
- run (open) Maha_Alkhairy_CS6620_HW3.ipynb to see the results
