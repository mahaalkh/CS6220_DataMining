** I used docker and ipython notebook to do the hw. 



- All the solutions are in FPGrowth_MahaAlkhairy.ipynb



- The images of the FPGrowth Trees for the written part are embedded in the python notebook FPGrowth_MahaAlkhairy.ipynb and are in the submission folder (.jpg) 



- Write_Venue_file.ipynb parses the data to get the venues grouped by author and writes the information to venue_baskets.txt sperated by ;  


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- To Run: 
 
 - please run Write_Venue_file.ipynb to get the venue_baskets.txt which is used in the third programming question
  
- I am referring to publications.txt and AP_train.txt in FPGrowth_MahaAlkhairy.ipynb as "publications.txt" and "AP_train.txt"
  
- run (open) FPGrowth_MahaAlkhairy.ipynb to see the results 
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difficulties: 
 
 - when installing docker on windows I had to upgrade my labtop from windows home to windows pro. 
 
 - when running FPGrowth with more than one partition, I would get an out of memory error when I shouldn't. Resolved by using only one partition in FPGrowth. 



Time spent: ~ 15 hrs (debugging took a long time)
